# Task 17.3

This is a simple example of creating and implementing an interface.

1. Edit `Interfaces.kt`. At the location indicated by the comment, add an
   interface named `Printable`. This should specify a single abstract method
   named `print()`, with an empty parameter list.

2. At the location indicated by the comment, add a class named `Document`
    with a `val` property named `filename`, of type `String`.

3. Make your `Document` class implement the `Printable` interface. Your
   implementation of `print()` should print the word "Printing" on the
   console, followed by the `filename` property.

4. Compile and run the program.
