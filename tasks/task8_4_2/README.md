# Task 8.4.2

An Amper project demonstrating the performance benefits of sequences.

The application operates on a text file, whose name should be supplied on
the command line. A large file (Leo Tolstoy's *War And Peace*) is provided.
This is over 3 MB in size and has over 66,000 lines of text.

Run the application with

    ./amper run war-and-peace.txt

You will see timings for an operation performed on this text file, with and
without the use of sequences.

If you are using the IntelliJ IDE, you should be able to open this directory
as an IntelliJ Project. The IDE should create a run configuration that can
be used to run the application.
