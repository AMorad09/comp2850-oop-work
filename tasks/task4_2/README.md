# Task 4.2

Put your solution in a file `Pizza.kt` in this directory.

Your program should

* Present a menu to the user consisting of four pizza options, labelled
  `a`, `b`, `c` and `d`

* Use `readln().lowercase()` to read the user's input and convert it
  to a lowercase string

* Use an `if` expression to check the length of the input string, and check
  the input is one of the allowed options (use a `Char` range here)

* Print "Order accepted" if the input is valid, "Invalid choice!" if it
  is not
