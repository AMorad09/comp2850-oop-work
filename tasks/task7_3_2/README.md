# Task 7.3.2

Copy your code for Task 7.3.1 to this directory.

Edit `List.kt` and modify it so that it creates a mutable list rather than
an immutable list.

Check that this fixes the compiler errors that you saw in Task 7.3.1.

Try out some of the list modification operations that are supported for
mutable lists.
