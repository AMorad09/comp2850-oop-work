# Task 5.1.2

Put your solution to this task in the file `Die.kt`.

You will need to add the `rollDie()` function from Section 5.1 of the notes.

You will need to write a `readInt()` function with a `String` parameter
representing a prompt. This function should

* Print the prompt
* Read input from the user
* Convert the input to an `Int` and return it

Finally, you will need to add a `main()` function that

* Uses `readInt()` to obtain the required number of die sides from the user
* Invokes `rollDie()` with the specified number of die sides
