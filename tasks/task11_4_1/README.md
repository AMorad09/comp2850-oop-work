# Task 11.4.1

Generate a UML class diagram using [draw.io][draw], as instructed in the
notes.

The diagram should be saved into the `task11_4_1` subdirectory of your
repository, as the file `student.drawio`.

You should also export the diagram as a PNG image, to the file `student.png`,
and include that file in the `task11_4_1` subdirectory.
