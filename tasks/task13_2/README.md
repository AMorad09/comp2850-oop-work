# Task 13.2

1. Study the code in `Time.kt` and `Main.kt`, and the unit tests in
   `TimeTest.kt`.

2. Try running the demo program with

       ./gradlew run

   Then run the unit tests with

       ./gradlew test

   They should all pass.

3. Refactor the tests in `TimeTest.kt`, creating a test fixture and removing
   unnecessary code duplication - see the notes for further details.

4. Rerun the tests, to check that they compile and that they still pass.
