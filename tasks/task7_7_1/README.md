# Task 7.7.1

Put your solution to this task in the file `Stats.kt`.

You will need to write a function that prompts the user to enter a series
of floating-point values, storing them in a list. The function should return
this list.

You can use Kotlin's `buildList()` function to construct the list of values.

You will need to write a function that computes the median of a list of
floating-point values. The list should be provided as a function parameter,
and the result of computation should be returned by the function.

Much of what you need for this task was mentioned in the discussion of
using extension functions on collections.
