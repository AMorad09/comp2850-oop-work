# Task 5.2.2

Put your solution to this task in the file `Grades.kt`.

You will need to add the expression form of the `grade()` function, from
Section 5.2 of the notes.

You will need to write a `main()` function that

* Iterates over the program's command line arguments using a `for` loop
* Converts each argument to an `Int`, representing an exam mark
* Invokes `grade()` on the exam mark, to determine the corresponding grade
* Prints both the mark and the grade
