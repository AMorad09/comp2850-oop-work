# Task 4.5

The code for this task should go in `OddSum.kt`.

The program should

* Prompt the user to enter an integer limit
* Use a `for` loop to sum up all of the odd integers between 1 and this limit
* Print the result of the summation

The program should support the use of reasonably large values for the limit.

Think carefully about the types of variables that you need to use here!
