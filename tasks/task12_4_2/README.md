# Task 12.4.2

1. Edit `Point.kt`. Add a `main()` function that creates a `Point` object
   and then calls `println()` on that object.

   Compile and run the program. What do you see?

2. Override `toString()` in the `Point` class, like this:

   ```kotlin
   override fun toString() = "($x, $y)"
   ```

3. Recompile the program and run it again. What has changed?
