# Task 12.3.3

**NOTE: you need to have completed Task 12.3.2 before starting this task!**

1. Copy `Person.kt` from the `task12_3_2` subdirectory of your repository
   into the `task12_3_3` subdirectory.

2. Edit the copied file and modify `main()` so that it reads the user's name
   and date of birth using `readln()`, then creates a `Person` object using
   these strings.

   Compile the program and run it to verify that you can create a `Person`
   with a zero-length name, or a name consisting only of spaces.

3. Modify the class so that it has the initializer block shown above.
   Recompile the program and try running it again to verify that invalid
   names trigger an exception.
