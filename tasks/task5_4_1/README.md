# Task 5.4.1

Put your solution to this task in the file `StringFunc.kt`.

In this file, you will need to create an extension function for `String`
named `tooLong()`. This function should return `true` if the length of the
string is greater than 20, otherwise `false`.

You will also need to add a `main()` that tests your extension function.
This will need to

* Prompt for entry of a string
* Use `readln()` to read in that string
* Use `tooLong()` to check whether it is too long
