# Task 5.2.1

Put your solution to this task in the file `Circle.kt`.

You will need to add `circleArea()` from Section 5.2 of the notes.

You will need to write a similar function to compute the perimeter of a
circle, giving it an expression body just like `circleArea()`.

You will need to add a third function, `readDouble()`, which has a `String`
parameter and a return type of `Double`. This function should

* Print the supplied string, as a prompt for the user
* Read the user's input
* Convert the input to a `Double` value
* Return this value

Finally, you will need to write a `main()` function that uses all three
of these functions. Your finished program should

* Read a value for circle radius from the user
* Compute the area & perimeter of a circle with this radius
* Display area & perimeter, with four decimal places of accuracy
