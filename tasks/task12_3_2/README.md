# Task 12.3.2

1. Edit `Person.kt`. Add to this file the `Person` class definition from
   the notes. Be sure to include the `import` statement as well.

2. Qdd a `main()` function that creates a `Person` object and then prints
   the person's name, date of birth and marital status.

   Check that your program compiles and runs successfully.

3. Dates are often manipulated as strings, in the standard ISO 8601 format
   (e.g., `"1997-08-23"`). Add a secondary constructor to `Person` that
   allows date of birth to be supplied as such a string.

   Check that your code compiles before moving on to the final step.

4. Modify `main()` so that when the `Person` object is created, date of
   birth is now specified as a string. Recompile and run the program
   to verify that it behaves as expected.
