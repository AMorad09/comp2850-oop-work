# Task 12.5.1

1. Examine `Person.kt`. This file contains an implementation of the `Person`
   class seen previously.

2. Compile `Person.kt` in the normal way. This should generate a file
   `Person.class`, containing the Java bytecode representation of the class.

3. In a terminal window, in the same directory as the bytecode file, run
   the Java class disassembler tool on it, like so:

       javap -p Person

   Study the output carefully.

   See the notes for further explanation.
