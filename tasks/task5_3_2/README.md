# Task 5.3.2

Put your solution to this task in the file `Dice.kt`.

You will need to write a function `rollDice()`, similar to the `rollDie()`
function of earlier tasks. This function will simulate the rolling of
**multiple dice**, all of the same type. It will need to add up the numbers
on each die and print the total.

The function will need two parameters: the number of sides (defaulting to 6),
and the number of dice required (defaulting to 1).

You will need to write a `main()` function that tests `rollDice()` in
various ways, using both the positional and named argument styles, and also
omitting arguments so that you can see the default values being used.
