# Task 12.1

This is an extended task, spanning all of the material in Section 12.1.

Once you've got to the end of this material, you should have two files in
the `task12_1` subdirectory of your repository.

The first file, `Point.kt`, should contain a Kotlin class to represent a
point in 2D space, plus a small program that demonstrates its use.

The second file, `point.py`, should contain the equivalent class and
program, written in Python.
