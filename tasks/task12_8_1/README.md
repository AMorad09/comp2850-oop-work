# Task 12.8.1

1. Edit `Enum.kt`. Add the `Day` enum class shown in the notes.

2. Add a `main()` function that asks the user to enter a day, reads that day
   as a string, then attempts to parse it using `Day.valueOf()`.

3. Compile and run the program. Try entering `Monday` as the string. Run it
   again, this time entering `monday`. What happens?

4. Modify the program so that it handles errors more gracefully and indicates
   to the user what their options are.
