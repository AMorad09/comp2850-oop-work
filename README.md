# Kotlin & Object-Oriented Programming

**(Alternate version, not using GitHub Classroom)**

This repository holds all of the work that you will do during the first
five weeks of COMP2850.

Each worksheet task occupies its own subdirectory of `tasks`, and each
portfolio assignment occupies its own subdirectory of `portfolio`. Please
take care to put your solutions in the correct subdirectory!

**We will inspect your code during the course of the module**, so pay
attention to code style and use sensible commit messages.

We've also provided some additional code examples, demonstrating how to
do various things in Kotlin. You'll find these in subdirectories of
`examples`.
